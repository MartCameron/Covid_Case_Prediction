Using a dataset of 20 factors, such as breathing problems, fever, sore throat, contact with a Covid patient, fatigue,
attending large gatherings, etc, to predict whether a person has Covid-19 or not. 

I used a RandomForestClassifier model and used cross validation to run the modeling process on different subsets of
the same dataset to get multiple measures.
